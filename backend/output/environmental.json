    "640 final. 3 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).

EN 2 EN aims to transform the Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The European Green Deal aims at decoupling economic growth from resource use, and ensuring that all regions and citizens of the Union participate in a socially just transition to a sustainable economic system so that no person and no place is left behind. It will contribute to the objective of building an economy that works for the people, strengthening the EU\u2019s social market economy, helping to ensure that it is future-ready and that it delivers stability, jobs, growth and sustainable investment. These goals are especially important considering the socio-economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for a sustainable, inclusive and fair recovery. In its proposal of 4 March 2020 for a European Climate Law, the European Commission proposed to make the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 binding in the Union4. Moreover, in its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the European Commission commits to ensure that by 2050 all of the world\u2019s ecosystems are restored, resilient, and adequately protected. This strategy aims to put Europe's biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030.",
    "In its Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth the Commission set out measures to achieve the following objectives: reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, manage financial risks stemming from climate change, resource depletion, environmental degradation and social issues, and foster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity5. The disclosure by certain categories of undertakings of relevant, comparable and reliable sustainability information is a prerequisite for meeting those objectives. The European Parliament and the Council adopted a number of legislative acts as part of the implementation of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth.

    "Of Directive 2013/34/EU, undertakings should therefore be required to disclose information about their business strategy and the resilience of the business model and strategy to risks related to sustainability matters. They should also be required to disclose any plans they may have to ensure that their business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable \u258ceconomy and with the objectives of limiting global warming to 1,5 \u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement and achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), with no or limited overshoot. It is especially important that plans related to climate are based on the latest science, including IPCC reports and reports by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. Information disclosed in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 about the amount of Capex or Opex associated with activities aligned with the taxonomy could support financial and investment plans related to these transition plans where appropriate. Undertakings should also be required to disclose whether and how their business model and strategy take account of the interests of stakeholders; any opportunities for This consolidated text has been automatically generated for information purposes only.

Once the disclosure of elements such as targets and the progress towards achieving them is required, the separate requirement to disclose the outcomes of policies is no longer necessary.",
    "Of Directive 2013/34/EU may rely on national, Union-based or international reporting frameworks, and where they do so, they have to specify which frameworks they relied upon. However, Directive 2013/34/EU does not require undertakings to use a common reporting framework or This consolidated text has been automatically generated for information purposes only. It has not been verified and may contain errors. EN 21 EN standard, and it does not prevent undertakings from choosing not to use any reporting framework or standards at all. As required by Article 2 of Directive 2014/95/EU, the Commission published in 2017 non-binding guidelines for undertakings under the scope of that Directive24. In 2019, the Commission published additional guidelines, specifically on reporting climate-related information25. The climate reporting guidelines explicitly incorporated the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Available evidence indicates that those non-binding guidelines did not have a significant impact on the quality of non-financial reporting by undertakings under the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. The voluntary nature of the guidelines means that undertakings are free to apply them or not. The guidelines can therefore not ensure on their own the comparability of the information disclosed by different undertakings, or the disclosure of all information that users consider relevant. That is why there is a need for mandatory common reporting standards to ensure that information is comparable and that all relevant information is disclosed. Building on the double-materiality principle, standards should cover all information that is material to users. Common reporting standards are also necessary to enable the audit and digitalisation of sustainability reporting and to facilitate its supervision and enforcement. The development of mandatory common sustainability reporting standards is necessary to progress to a situation in which sustainability information has a status comparable to that of financial information. The adoption of sustainability reporting standards by means of Delegated Regulations will ensure harmonised sustainability reporting across the Union. Therefore, an undertaking would be compliant with the requirements of Articles 19a and 29a by reporting according to the sustainability reporting standards. When defining such standards, it is essential to give due consideration and to the greatest extent possible to the main sustainability reporting standards used worldwide, while not lowering the ambition of this Directive and its Delegated acts.",

The reporting standards should therefore specify the information that undertakings are to disclose on all major environmental factors, including their impacts and dependencies on climate, air, land, water and biodiversity. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 provides a classification of the environmental objectives of the Union. For reasons of coherence, it is appropriate to use a similar classification to identify the environmental factors that should be addressed by sustainability reporting standards. The reporting standards should consider and specify any geographical or other contextual information that undertakings should disclose to provide an understanding of their principal impacts on sustainability matters and the principal risks to the undertaking arising from sustainability matters. When specifying the information about environmental factors that undertakings are to disclose, coherence should be ensured with the definitions in Article 2 and the reporting requirements of Article 8 in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to that Regulation.",
    "With regard to climate-related information, users are interested in knowing about undertakings\u2019 physical and transition risks, and about their resilience and plans to adapt to different climate scenarios and to the EU\u2019s climate neutrality goal. They are also interested in the level and scope of greenhouse gas emissions and removals attributed to the undertaking, including the extent to which the undertaking uses offsets and the source of those offsets. Achieving a climate neutral economy requires the alignment of greenhouse gas accounting and offset standards. Users need reliable information regarding offsets that addresses concerns regarding possible double-counting and overestimations, given the risks to the achievement of climate-related targets that double-counting and overestimations can create. These parties are also interested to know the efforts made by companies to effectively reduce absolute GHG emissions as part of their climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including scope 1, scope 2 and, where relevant, scope 3 emissions. With regard to scope 3 emissions, a priority for users is to receive information about which categories of scope 3 are significant in the case of the undertaking, and about the emissions in each of those scope 3 categories. The reporting standards should therefore specify the information undertakings should report with regard to those matters.
