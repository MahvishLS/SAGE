    "On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a new global sustainable development framework: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the \u20182030 Agenda\u2019). The 2030 Agenda has at its core the Sustainable Development Goals and covers the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. The Commission communication of 22 November 2016 on the next steps for a sustainable European future linked the Sustainable Development Goals to the Union policy framework to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both in and beyond the Union, take those goals on board at the outset.17 In its conclusions of 20 June 2017, the Council confirmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrated and effective manner, in close cooperation with partners and other stakeholders18.",
    "The ultimate beneficiaries of better sustainability reporting by undertakings are individual citizens and savers, including trade unions and workers\u2019 representatives to be adequately informed and thereby to better engage in social dialogue. Savers who want to invest sustainably will have the opportunity to do so, while all citizens should benefit from a stable, sustainable and inclusive economic system. To realise these benefits, the sustainability information disclosed in undertaking\u2019s annual reports first has to reach two primary groups (\u2018users\u2019). The first group of users consists of investors, including asset managers, who want to better understand the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues pose to their investments and the impacts of those investments on people and the environment. The second group of users consists of \u258ccivil society actors, including non-governmental organisations and social partners, that wish to better hold undertakings to account for their impacts on people and the environment. Other stakeholders may also make use of sustainability information disclosed in annual reports, notably to foster comparability across and within market sectors. The business partners of undertakings, including customers, may rely on this information to understand, and where necessary report on, the sustainability risks and impacts through their own value chains. Policy makers and environmental agencies may use such information, in particular on an aggregate basis, to monitor environmental and social trends, to contribute to environmental accounts, and to inform public policy. Few individual citizens and consumers directly consult undertaking\u2019s reports, but they may use such information indirectly such as when considering the advice or opinions of financial advisers or non-governmental organisations. Many investors and asset managers purchase sustainability information from third party data providers, who collect information from various sources, including public corporate reports. (8a) The market for sustainability information is rapidly growing, and the role of data providers is gaining in importance with the new obligations that investors and asset managers need to fulfil. With the increased availability of disaggregated data, sustainability information should come at a more reasonable cost. The amended Directive 2013/34 is expected to increase the comparability of data and harmonise This consolidated text has been automatically generated for information purposes only.

    "There has been a very significant increase in demand for corporate sustainability information in recent years, especially on the part of the investment community. That increase in demand is driven by the changing nature of risks to undertakings and growing investor awareness of the financial implications of these risks. That is especially the case for climate-related financial risks. Awareness \u258cis also growing on the risks and opportunities to undertakings and to investments resulting from other environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss, and from health and social issues, including on child labour and forced labour \u258c. The increase in demand for sustainability information is also driven by the growth in investment products that explicitly seek to meet certain sustainability standards or achieve certain sustainability objectives and to ensure coherence with the ambition of the Paris Agreement, Convention on Biological diversity and Union policies. Part of that increase is the logical consequence of previously adopted Union legislation, notably Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Some of the increase would have happened in any case, due to fast-changing citizen awareness, consumer preferences and market practices. The COVID-19 pandemic will further accelerate the increase in users\u2019 information needs, in particular as it has exposed the vulnerabilities of workers and of undertaking\u2019s value chains. Information on environmental impacts is also relevant in the context of mitigating future pandemics with human disturbance of ecosystems increasingly linked to the occurrence and spread of diseases.",
    "To ensure consistency with international instruments such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, the due diligence disclosure requirements should be specified in greater detail than is the case in Article 19a.",
    "Of Directive 2013/34/EU. Due diligence is the process that undertakings carry out to identify, track, prevent, mitigate, remediate and bring an end to the principal actual and potential adverse impacts connected with their activities and identifies how they address those adverse impacts. Impacts connected with an undertaking\u2019s activities include impacts directly caused by the undertaking, impacts to which the undertaking contributes, and impacts which are otherwise linked to the undertaking\u2019s value chain. The due diligence process concerns the whole value chain of the undertaking including its own operations, its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chains. In alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, an actual or potential adverse impact is to be considered principal where it measures among the greatest impacts connected with the undertaking\u2019s activities based on: the gravity of the impact on people or the environment; the number of individuals that are or could be affected, or the scale of damage to the environment; and the ease with which the harm could be remediated, restoring the environment or affected people to their prior state.",
    "Sustainability reporting standards should also take account of internationally recognised principles and frameworks on responsible business conduct, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable development, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and related sectoral guidelines, the UN Global Compact, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles of the International Labour Organisation concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility, and the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.",
    "Sustainability reporting standards should specify the information that undertakings should disclose on social factors, including working conditions, social partner involvement, collective bargaining, equality, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion, \u258cand human rights. Such information should cover the impacts of the undertaking on people, including workers, and on human health. The information that undertakings disclose about human rights should include information about forced labour and child labour in their value chains where relevant. Reporting requirements on forced labour should not replace the public authorities\u2019 responsibility to address the import of goods, produced as a result of human rights abuses, including forced labour, through trade policy and diplomatic means. Undertakings should also be able to report on possible risks and trends regarding employment and incomes. Reporting standards that address social factors should specify the information that undertakings should disclose with regard to the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights that are relevant to businesses, including equal opportunities for all and working conditions. The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan adopted in March 2021 calls for stronger requirements on undertakings to report on social issues. The reporting standards should also specify the information that undertakings should disclose with regard to the human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles and standards established in the International Bill of Human Rights and other core UN human rights conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the European Convention of Human Rights, the (revised) European Social Charter, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

Ultimately, late payments lead to insolvency and bankruptcy, with destructive effects on entire value chains. Increasing information about payment practices should empower other undertakings to identify prompt and reliable payers, detect unfair payment practices, access information about the businesses they trade with, and negotiate fairer payment terms.",
    "The reporting standards should promote a more integrated view of all the information published by undertakings in the management report to provide users of that information with a better understanding of the development, performance, position and impact of the undertaking. Those standards should distinguish as necessary between information that undertakings should disclose when reporting at individual level and the information that undertakings should disclose when reporting at consolidated level. Those standards should also contain guidance for undertakings on the process carried out to identify the sustainability information that should be included in the management report, since an undertaking should only be required to disclose the information relevant to understand its impacts on sustainability matters, and the information relevant to understand how sustainability matters affect its development, performance and position. (45a) Member States should ensure that sustainability reporting is done in compliance with workers\u2019 rights to information and consultation. The management of the undertaking should hence inform workers' representatives at the appropriate level and discuss with 34 Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions (OJ L 48, 23.2.2011, p. 1).

    "Undertakings in the same sector are often exposed to similar sustainability-related risks, and they often have similar impacts on society and the environment. Comparisons between undertakings in the same sector are especially valuable to investors and other users of sustainability information. Sustainability reporting standards adopted by the Commission should therefore specify both information that undertakings in all sectors should disclose and information that undertakings should disclose depending on their sector of activity. Sector-specific standards are especially important in the case of sectors associated with high sustainability risks and/or impacts on the environment, human rights and governance, including sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006, and the relevant activities within those. When adopting sector specific standards the Commission should ensure this information is proportionate to the scale of the risks and impacts related to sustainability matters of each sector, taking account of the fact that the risks and impacts of some sectors are higher than for others. The Commission should also take account of the fact that not all activities within such sectors are necessarily associated with high sustainability risks and/or impacts. For undertakings that operate in sectors particularly relying on natural resources, sector-specific standards would require the disclosure of nature-related impacts on and risks for biodiversity and ecosystems. Standards should also take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain, especially from SME suppliers and from suppliers in emerging markets and economies.

    "Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU requires undertakings with securities listed on regulated markets to include a corporate governance statement in their management report, which has to contain among other information a description of the diversity policy applied by the undertaking in relation to its administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU leaves flexibility to undertakings to decide what aspects of diversity they report on. It does not explicitly oblige undertakings to include information on any particular aspect of diversity. In order to progress towards a more gender-balanced participation in economic decision-making, it is necessary to ensure that undertakings with securities listed on regulated markets always report on their gender diversity policies and the implementation thereof. However, to avoid unnecessary administrative burden, those undertakings should have the possibility to report some of the information required by Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU alongside other sustainability-related information. If they decide to do so, the corporate governance statement needs to include a reference to the undertaking\u2019s sustainability reporting, and the information compliant with Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU should remain subject to the assurance requirements of the corporate governance statement.",
