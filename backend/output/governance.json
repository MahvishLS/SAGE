The report also identified as significant problems the limited comparability and reliability of sustainability information.

    "In the absence of policy action, the gap between users\u2019 information needs and the sustainability information reported by undertakings is expected to grow. This gap has significant negative consequences. Investors are unable to take sufficient account of sustainability-related risks and opportunities in their investment decisions. The aggregation of multiple investment decisions that do not take adequate account of sustainability-related risks has the potential to create systemic risks that threaten financial stability. The European Central Bank and international organisations such as the Financial Stability Board have drawn attention to those systemic risks, in particular in the case of climate. Investors are also less able to channel financial resources to undertakings and economic activities that address and do not exacerbate social and environmental problems, which undermines the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and the objectives of the Paris agreement. Non-governmental organisations, social partners, communities affected by undertakings\u2019 activities, and other stakeholders are less able to hold undertakings accountable for their impacts on people and the environment.
